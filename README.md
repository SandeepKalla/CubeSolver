# CubeSolver

A 3x3 Rubik's Cube solver implementation that provides algorithmic solutions for solving scrambled Rubik's cubes.

## Overview

CubeSolver is designed to analyze a given 3x3 Rubik's cube state and generate step-by-step solutions to solve it efficiently. The project implements cube-solving algorithms to find optimal or near-optimal move sequences.

## Features

- **3x3 Rubik's Cube Solving**: Core functionality for solving standard 3x3 Rubik's cubes
- **Interactive Web Interface**: User-friendly HTML/CSS/JavaScript implementation
- **Real-time Visualization**: Visual cube representation and manipulation
- **Algorithm Implementation**: Utilizes established cube-solving methods
- **Move Generation**: Provides step-by-step solution sequences
- **Cube State Analysis**: Processes current cube configurations

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- Basic understanding of Rubik's cube notation

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SandeepKalla/CubeSolver.git
cd CubeSolver
```

2. Open the project:
```bash
# Simply open index.html in your web browser
# Or serve it using a local server
python -m http.server 8000
# Then navigate to http://localhost:8000
```

## Usage

Open `index.html` in your web browser to start using the cube solver.

[Add specific usage instructions based on your implementation]

```javascript
